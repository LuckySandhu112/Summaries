> Why Now is the Best Time to Be a Developer
Is it possible that in the next few years someone could develop a billion-dollar company without any developers — just with vibe coding?

The CEO of GitHub, Thomas Dohmke, says no. He believes:

“You have to be a developer to be in the tech business. What you can do with the help of AI without coding — everybody else can do as well. The idea of building a billion-dollar company with vibe coding or something like that, and without actual coding, is mistaken. If that were the case, everyone would be doing it.”

> Even Kids Can Start Now
Thomas mentioned that he expects many more developers in the future — because it's now so much easier to learn.

“Even kids can learn by simply typing into AI tools like Copilot: ‘Hey, how do I build a game?’”

> Will AI Take All the Work?
Let’s say 90% of all code in the future is written by AI agents. That sounds like developers will have only 10% left to do.

But here's the catch:

If the total volume of software work grows 10x, AI does 9x, and humans still do 1x — that’s still more work than before, and it's more valuable.

Developers become more efficient with AI, not obsolete.

> Companies That Use AI to Accelerate (Not Cut Costs) Will Succeed
Companies that use AI as a productivity accelerator, not just for cost-cutting, are the ones seeing the most success.

> What Should New Coders Focus On?
If you're learning coding now, here’s what to focus on to land a good job or salary:

Learn core programming fundamentals

Learn how to use AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT

Understand how AI works and how to build with it

Practice problem-solving and system design

Focus on real-world projects and team collaboration

According to Thomas, the next generation should grow up learning how to use AI tools effectively — not just how to code manually.

> Will AI Generate Better Ideas Than Humans?
AI can help generate better ideas, but it’s not about replacing human creativity.

AI is incredibly powerful for reflection, brainstorming, and speeding up ideation — but humans are still key to vision, judgment, and context.

> Final Advice to Those Afraid AI Will Take Their Jobs
“The best way to overcome fear is to adopt the technology.
Learn about it. Use it. Upskill yourself into whatever the next job is going to be.”

> What is Vibe Coding?
Vibe coding = AI-assisted coding based on intuition rather than deep technical understanding.
It’s fast, flashy, but not a replacement for actual engineering knowledge.

> AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
A theoretical concept in AI where a machine possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply intelligence to any intellectual task that a human can.
