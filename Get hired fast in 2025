Software engineer is not about just coding. It is about documentation, communication, client interaction and also coding.

If you are in a service company its very hard to switch from service to product based companies so try to opt for job in product based company rather then a service based.

Common questions interviewer asks for the one who's pursuing in java?

Interviewer asks only basic fundamentals to the person with 1-1.5 year of experience.
Fundamental like OOPS, should know the real implementation in codes.

We can make codes using AI but if we don't know the real implementation that what the code is actually doing you can't secure a good package or job in IT field.

A fresher should know the skill, how to reach out on LinkedIn, how to get referrals.

In product based companies you have to do everything on your own no one has a time to help you through your problem. 

You have to build your profile in such a way that someone finds it interesting and knows you have a good amount of knowledge will reach out to you for hiring.

In java primary focus on Spring boot, Micro services, web services, on Kafka at least java 8 should be mastered and has an overview over cloud.
