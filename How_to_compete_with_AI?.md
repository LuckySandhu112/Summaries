How Do You Compete with AI?
(Against or Using AI?)

According to a survey by Dharmesh Shah, Co-founder and CTO of HubSpot:
34% of people chose to compete against AI, 66% of people chose to work using AI

How Does AI Work?
GPT = Generative Pre-trained Transformer
Generative – to generate what should come next
Example:
The horse jumped over the ______
Predicted probabilities:

a) Fence (0.45)

b) Hurdle (0.20)

c) Wall (0.15)

d) Log (0.10)

e) Moon (0.05)

> If we choose (a), the sentence becomes:
The horse jumped over the fence
If we ask AI to continue the sentence, it might generate:
...then galloped across the field.

> Final output:
The horse jumped over the fence then galloped across the field.

> Pre-training
Passing a large amount of text through a large language model (LLM) to learn patterns and predict what comes next.

TEXT → LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL → PREDICTION
LLMs are like autocomplete with a Ph.D. in everything.

> AI Bridges Humans and Machines

Human <<<---------- AI Generation ---------->>> Computer
         Text, Image, Video               Code
> We Are Now in the Age of AI Agents
What is an AI Agent?
Software that uses AI to accomplish a stated goal that requires multiple steps.
