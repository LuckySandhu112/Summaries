What is the black box effect?

The black box in any situation where we have a input turning
into output through some process in the middle and when we 
don't know how the input actually becomes the output, that's
what create the black box.

Its an effect which helps in improving learning skills and 
work more efficient.

With the help of black box effect we can convert our time 
and effort into performance.

 1) NEVER PRACTICE 2) SHIFT FROM   3) ASK WHY 
     AN ISOLATION     RANDOM TO    CONSTANTLY 
                      TARGETED
                      PRACTICE


1) Practice doesn't make perfect only practicing
properly with right approach, learning from mistakes,
Reflecting and realising necessary changes.


2) Random practices leads to random results so practice
doing the thing which will eventually help for the outcome
to be perfect and should take less time. Do targeted 
practice instead of random practices.


3) If we learn anything by putting the question why such
why is the output of this is that, why this comes here, 
why, why, why Then you can see that in some time you will
be learning the things more efficiently and fast.


WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS VIDEO - The Black Box Effect: How To Learn ANY Skill Quickly-

I have seen the same things mentioned in this video have
been told to me earlier by my teachers, relatives or parents.
And this helps me in doing more stuff in less time, it saves
my time, I get less exhausted and rarely got burn out. This 
helps me in learning anything fast and efficient.
