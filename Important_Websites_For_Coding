Top 10 Java programming best practices-->

Programming is a mind sport where programmers strive
to find the best solution to problems as quickly as 
possible. Java is majorly used in software development 
industry.

What is java programming?
Java is one of the most popular programming languages
created in 1995, used to create various applications 
such as Mobile applications, Desktop applications, and
other Web applications. Java is an object oriented 
language that gives a clear structure to programs and 
allow code to be reused, lowering development costs.

1) Follow coding standards and best practices---
Following coding standards is essential for the 
consistency and readability of code in both software
code as well as normal programming code as it helps 
to debug and remove errors in the code.

2) Using efficient Data Structures---
In java programming, choosing the right data structure
is critical for the optimal performance of the code. 
Data structures can help you optimize your code and 
bring down the time and space complexity of the code.

3) Using Efficient Algorithms during coding contests---
In programming, the efficiency of the used algorithms 
can make a significant difference in the performance of
the code. When searching for an element in an array, it 
is better to use binary search instead of linear search.

4) Minimizing Input and Output operations---
It is essential to minimize the number of I/O operations
as much as possible. 

5) Avoiding excessive object creation in java---
It is best to avoid excessive object creation whenever 
possible during contests.

6) Use of java standard library collections---
The java standard library collections which is comparable
with C++ provides a wide range of classes and methods 
functions that can be used for solving various problems 
efficiently and optimally.

7) StringBuilder for String Manipulation---
String are immutable in java, which means that
each time a string is modified, a new string 
object is created in memory.

8) Use of Bitwise Operators---
Bitwise operators can be used to solve problems
more efficiently. Bitwise AND,OR,XOR and shift 
operations can be used for various bitwise
manipulations.

9) Multithreading---
Multithreading can be used to improve the 
performance of the code during programming.
If the problem during the contest involves 
processing large data, you can divide the data
into smaller chunks and process them in parallel
using multiple threads.

10) Output---
It is important to optimize your code for 
performance during the contet. This can 
involve various techniques such as loops 
unrolling, reducing branching, and minimizing
variable assignments


-------------------------------------------------------

By following these practices, you will be better 
prepared for software development projects

Java best practices-->

BE CLEAR, NOT CLEVER---

The primary purpose of code is to be understand and
maintained, not to serve as a showcase of technical
skills.

KEEP IT SHORT---
Make sure your methods and classes aren't too long. 
While there's no strict rule regarding the exact number
of lines or words for a class.
If you want to practice recognizing methods that are
too long here's a video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqkqDn21OMI.

NAMING IS HARD, SO DO IT WITH CARE---
Proper names for methods and variables serve as direct,
intuitive guides to understanding the purpose and function
of your code.

TEST,TEST,TEST---
Testing your code is necessary to ensure your app works 
as expected and will continue to work as it changes. 
You can read this blog for more information on tests -

>> LANGUAGE SPECIFIC
* Use switch expressions instead of excessive if else statements.

* Avoid empty catch blocks

* Logging the exception

* Logging the exception and rewriting it

* Logging the exception and returning an alternate value

* Choose collection over Arrays.

>> PROJECT SPECIFIC
* Keep dependencies up to date.

* Check for vulnerable dependicies and APIs

* Avoid circular dependicies
