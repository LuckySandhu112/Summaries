How Large Language Model Work?

1) Data Collection and Tokenization.
LLMs are trained on massive text datasets (web pages, books, articles, code, etc.).
Text is split into tokens (words, subwords, or characters).
For example:
"How are you?" → [ "How", " are", " you", "?" ]



2) Pretraining with Transformer Architecture.
Using the transformer model and self-attention mechanisms, the system learns to predict the next token in a sequence.
Example:
Input: "The cat is on the"
Model predicts: "mat" with high probability.



3) Fine Tuning for Specific Tasks.
Most LLMs use the Transformer architecture.
Key components:
Embedding Layer, Self-Attention Mechanism, Feedforward Layers


4) Inference and Response Generation.
The model generates responses based on input prompts at inference time by predicting the next most likely tokens. 


5) Optimization and Deployment.
Before deployment, the model is compressed and filtered to ensure speed, efficiency, and safety. It’s then deployed in environments like cloud platforms and edge devices for real-world use.
