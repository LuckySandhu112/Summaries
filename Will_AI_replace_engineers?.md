> Logan Kilpatrick at Google I/O – AI Growth & Developer Insights
Logan Kilpatrick mentions in his interview at Google I/O that over the past year, there has been a 40–50x growth in AI usage across Google.

The Gemini app now has 400+ million users and 7+ million developers.

According to Logan, AI performs only 1–2% of the work, and the remaining 98–99% is still done by developers.

He emphasizes that:

The human experience is one of the most differentiated things, because experience is not part of training data — everyone has a different background.

> Why Are All These Companies Building AI?
Because AI benefits humanity in practical ways:

Finding the best restaurant nearby

Figuring out what ingredients are needed for a recipe

Getting instant, personalized help through intelligent systems

AI helps speed up coding and improve understanding.

Example: If two people are working on the same project — one using AI, the other not — the one using AI will finish faster and with more ease.

> According to Logan, now is the best time to become a developer.

> Conclusion
AI boosts speed, creativity, and productivity in coding — helping developers build better things than ever before.

> Key Terms & Concepts
JULIA
A high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, designed for speed and productivity.
Commonly used in:
Data science
Artificial intelligence
Machine learning
Modeling and simulation
Numerical analysis & computational science

WRAPPERS
Simplified interfaces or layers built around complex code, libraries, or APIs.
They help developers interact with core functionality without needing to manage low-level operations — speeding up integration and development.

APPLICATION LAYER
The top layer of software systems that users directly interact with — such as:

Applications

User interfaces

Services

It provides user-facing features, built on top of the underlying technical infrastructure.

COMMODITY LAYER
Describes foundational resources like:

Compute power

Data storage

Network services

These are:
Widely available
Easily replaceable
Low-cost

They form the building blocks for specialized or custom software solutions.

AI CO-PRESENCE
AI systems that observe user activity (e.g., screen viewing or listening to conversations) to:

Understand context

Proactively provide relevant assistance

Similar to having a helpful AI companion nearby.

MULTIMODAL AI
AI systems that can process multiple data types at once, such as:

Text
Images
Audio
Video

This enables more natural, human-like interaction.

SINGLE AUTHENTICATION
A secure login method allowing users to sign in once and access multiple connected applications or services.
This:

Streamlines the user experience

Maintains security

Eliminates repeated logins

DISTRIBUTION AND LOCK-IN EFFECTS
Distribution effects: How quickly and widely a product spreads.

Lock-in effects: When users become dependent on a product, making it difficult to switch to competitors.

Together, they influence:

Market dominance

User retention and loyalty

JULES
Jules is an asynchronous, agentic coding assistant that integrates directly with your existing repositories.

It:
Securely understands your entire project context
Automatically writes tests
Builds new features
Fixes bugs
Updates dependencies
Generates audio summaries of code changes
