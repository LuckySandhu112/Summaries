Logan Kilpatrick mentions in his interview at Google I/O that from past 1 year there is a growth of 40-50x in AI usage across Google.
Gemini app has 400 million+ users and 7+ million developers.
According to Logan the AI does the 1-2% of the work and rest 98-99% is done by developers.
The human experience is one of the most differentiated thing as once experience is not any training data everyone has a different background.

WHY ARE ALL THESE COMPANIES BUILDING AI??
It's because this thing benefits humanity as we want to find something like a best restaurant near us or we have to make some stuff and we need to know what all things we need so we can ask AI and it will help a lot.

AI boosts the speed and understanding of making codes, as an example we have two people one who uses AI in his project and the another one who doesn't the one who is using AI will make the project more easily and fast than the other one.

According to Logan now is the best time to become a developer.

The conclusion- AI will help to boost the speed, the creativity in code, and making better things than the things that had been made in past.




JULIA-It is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, designed to be fast and productive, for example- Data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, modelling and simulation, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science.

WRAPPERS- Wrappers are simplified interfaces or layers built around complex code, libraries, or APIs. They allow developers to easily interact with underlying functionalities without needing to manage detailed or complex operations directly, helping speed up integration and development.

APPLICATION LAYER- The application layer refers to the top of software systems that users interact with directly- such as applications, user interfaces, or services. it provides specific functions and user-facing features, built on underlying technical infrastructure.

COMMODITY LAYER- The commodity layer describes foundational resources(like compute power, data storage, or network services) that are widely available, easily interchangeable, and usually low-cost. These low-cost. These serve as the basic building blocks on which specialized or custom software solutions are developed.

AI CO PRESENCE- AI co presence refers to AI systems that continuously observe users activities (such as viewing a screen or listening to conversations) to understand context and proactively provide relevant assistance, similar to having a helpful companion nearby.

MULTIMODAL AI- Multimodal AI means AI systems that can process multiple data types- like text, images, audio, and video all at once. For example, an AI that can read text, recognize images, and listen to speech simultaneously, creating more natural and human like interactions.

SINGLE AUTHENTICATION- Single authentication is a login method allowing users to securely sign in just once to gain access across multiple connected applicants or services. it streamlines user experience by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter usernames and passwords for each service while maintaining security.

DISTRIBUTION AND LOCK IN EFFECTS- Distribution effects refers to how quickly and wildely a product spreads among users, while Lock-in Effects happen when users become dependent on a product, making it harder to switch to competitors. Together,these effects can strongly influence market dominance and user loyalty.

JULES- Jules is an asynchronous, agentic coding assistant that integrates directly with your existing repositries. it securely understands your entire projext context, automatically writing tests,building new features, fixing bugs, updating dependecles, and generating ausio summaries of code changes.
