AI prompting: Techniques and Best Practices:

What is a Prompt?
It is a natural language text input that describes the task or query that we want to address. It can be as short as a single question or a longer statement that includes background information and instructions.

What is Prompt Engineering?
It is the art and science of crafting prompts to get information from the best possible results from an AI model. It involves techniques like phrasing instructions clearly, providing context or examples. 
Prompt engineering is essentially a process of trial-and-error and refinement: you might start with a basic query and then iteratively improve it (rewording the prompt, adding constraints, etc.) until the AI's output meets your requirements. It's become such a crucial skill that it's often considered a key competency for developers and users working with AI, helping to avoid nonsensical or irrelevant outputs by guiding the model effectively.

Key Components of an Effective Prompt--
1) Instruction: The specific task or command you want the model to perform.  
2) Context: Any relevant background information or context that the model might need to produce a better answer.
3) Input: The specific data or query you want the model to respond to.
4) Output Indicator: A description of the desired output format or type.


Zero shot vs Few Shot Prompting--

Zero shot->
In this you ask model to perform a task without giving any examples.

Few Shot Prompting->
In this you include a few examples of the task in the prompt itself to help the model understand the pattern or format before it answers your actual query.

Prompt Chaining->
Sometimes a task you want the AI to do is complex or multi-step. Prompt chaining typically works like this: you identify the subtasks that make up the complex task, then prompt the model for the first subtask.
