Is it normal to not be able to solve LeetCode?

Yes, it is completely normal to struggle with LeetCode problems, especially when you're starting out or tackling more complex problems. LeetCode is designed to challenge your problem solving skills, and even experienced developers often find certain problems difficult.

1) LeetCode Problems are Designed to be Difficult:
LeetCode problems, especially Medium and Hard ones, are often crafted to test your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques.

2) LeetCode is a Learning Tool, Not a Test of Intelligence:
It's important to remember that it is a practice platform, so if you stuck in any problem try to learn it don't leave it by saying its difficult because it is only for your good, as you'll explore more on LeetCode you will learn plenty of things.

3. Many Developers Struggle with Certain Problems:
Dynamic Programming-> This is a topic many find tricky at first, and it takes time to develop an intuition for solving problems in this domain.



Graphs and Trees->
Problems involving graph traversal (BFS, DFS) or tree manipulation can be conceptually difficult for beginners.



4. Struggling is normal:
If you are stuck in any problem don't leave it because you are not alone who's stuck on that problem there are many other users who also faces some problems, it is not necessary that at first go you will find a solution for your question but as you practice more and more you will be confident enough to solve any problem.



Focus on understanding, Not just solving:
Take your time to understand the problem, break it down into smaller steps, and learn the underlying concepts before jumping into coding.



How to approach LeetCode problems when you're stuck:
Break down the problem statement into smaller parts, This helps reduce the complexity and allows you to solve the problem step by step.
Learn from solutions provided in LeetCode.

5. Long-Term Learning Approach:
Review problems you struggled with, Go back to problems you couldn’t solve after a few days or weeks. Try solving them again without looking at the solution.


6. Use LeetCode as a Learning Tool, Not Just a Measure of Skill
LeetCode is a tool to improve your coding and problem-solving skills, not a metric to measure your abilities. If you find yourself struggling to solve problems, remind yourself that you’re in the process of learning, and every problem solved (or attempted) brings you closer to mastery.

Conclusion:
Practice as much as you can don't leave it by saying i can't understand it or it's hard. Keep practicing after a certain time you will find that you are learning it and doing great and writing good codes.
