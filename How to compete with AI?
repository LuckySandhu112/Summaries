How do you compete with AI?
(Against or using AI)
According to a survey made by Dharmesh co founder and CTO of HubSpot 34% of the people choose against AI and 66% of people chose using AI.

HOW AI works?
GPT(Generative Pre-training Transformer)
Generative-to generate what should come next 
example-   A horse jumped over the ______
                       Chances   
           a) Fence    (0.45)
           b) Hurdle   (0.20)
           c) Wall     (0.15)
           d) Log      (0.10)
           e) Moon     (0.05)

if we choose (a) 
the sentence will be-- The horse jumped over the fence
and if we say to generate a line which continues the sentence the AI will add something like-- then galloped across the field.
The whole sentence will be-- The horse jumped over the fence then galloped across the field.

Pre training-to pass the text to a large language model and then predicting what should come next.

TEXT-->LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL-->PREDICTION

LLMs are like autocomplete with a PHD in everything 

Human <<<----------AI generation---------->>>Computer
 Text, Image, Video                    Code

We are now in the age of AI agents.
What is AI agent ?
Software that uses AI to accomplish a stated goal requiring multiple steps.


"AI won't take your job Someone using AI will"
