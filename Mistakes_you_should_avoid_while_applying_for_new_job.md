It took Nitin Srivastava(Data Architect) 17+ years to realize what he is going to tell---

He has worked in many companies Accenture, Impetus,American  Express, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Amazon.

The Mistakes you should avoid--

1) Stop waiting to know Everything just apply---

Today many people start preparations and study to
get new job or to switch to another company but you
just have to be honest and confident about your ability.
Here's what company really wants "They write wish lists
not requirements" . They want superman man but they will
hire Clark Kent if he can solve their problems and learn
quickly.  The real question is not do I know everything,
it is, Can I learn everything that I don't know.

2) Master the Art of Learning, Not just Tools---

Start learning how to learn not just what to learn.
You simply can't learn every single tool that exists
but the fundamental never changes and the process of
learning itself. 

3) Perfection is you Career killer---

Perfection is not a virtue in tech, it's a trap. Be 
the one who can write decent codes, understand 
bussiness requirements, architect solutions and
explain complex technical concepts to non-technical
people. Most of the time you don't need to be the 
world's best expert in a tool. You need to be good 
enough to solve all the problems at hand and confident
enough to learn more when a situation demands it.
" Done is better than perfect "

4) You'll Never feel Ready to take Action anyway---

Confidence doesn't come before competence. It comes 
after. Every senior engineer, every architect, every
tech lead has the same story, They got promoted or 
landed their dream job while feeling like they over 
in over their head. Apply for that stretch role, Take
on that challenging project, Volunteer for that 
migratrion.

5) Problrm Solving and Communication Trump Everything---

Everyone applying for the same role has same technical
skills. What differentiate you is your ability to think
beyond the code to understand the bigger picture to 
communicate  effectively and to take ownership of 
outcomes. Take ownership of the end-to-end solution,
not just your piece of code. 

6) Nobody Cares about your code, as much as you do---

Good code does matter, but clean maintainable code is
important. It's a mean to an end, not the end itself.
Your value is not in writing perfect code. It is in 
delivering the solutions that move the business forward.

7) Burnout is Real and Career-Ending---

Burnout is not a badge of honor. It's a career killer
and it's completely preventable Burnout doesn't make
you more productive. it makes you less creative, more
prone to mistakes, harder to work with. Sustainable 
careers aren't built on sprints. They are built on consistency. Manage your energy wisely. Protect your mental health and you will have a long successful fulfilling career.
